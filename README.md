# Dropdown-Menu

Write a short, HTML drop-down menu using native JavaScript to control its behavior (bonus points for reusability). The menu should begin with a single button that reveals a drop-down with 5 menu items when you hover over it. Hovering over one of the 5 menu items should reveal a second drop-down menu to the right of the original menu with an additional 5 items.
